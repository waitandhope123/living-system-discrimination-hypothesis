# Living-System Discrimination Hypothesis (Phase 1)

This repository contains a preregistered empirical test of the **Living-System Discrimination Hypothesis (Phase 1)**.

The sole purpose of this project is to determine whether humans can discriminate the presence or spatial location of living systems at above-chance levels under strict blinding, using a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) design with a binary stopping rule.

This is an existence test. It is not a theory of mechanism, consciousness, or ontology.

## Scope

**This project tests exactly one claim:**

> Humans may be able to discriminate the presence or spatial location of living systems above chance under conditions that eliminate known sensory cues.

The experiment is designed such that:
- A positive result indicates only that a signal *may* exist and warrants independent replication.
- A null result decisively rejects the hypothesis and terminates the project.

No reinterpretation or theory rescue is permitted.

## What This Repository Is

- A fully specified, preregistered experimental protocol
- A public commitment to falsifiability and stopping rules
- A record intended to prevent duplication of effort regardless of outcome
- An example of how to reduce a subjective intuition to a testable empirical question

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This project does **not** claim or assume:
- the existence of fields, forces, or substrates
- non-physical mechanisms
- consciousness-based explanations
- psychic or paranormal abilities
- implications for physics, cosmology, or metaphysics

All such interpretations are explicitly out of scope unless supported by independent evidence beyond Phase 1.

---

## Project Status

Phase 1 is locked and preregistered.  
Data collection has not yet begun.

If Phase 1 fails to show above-chance performance under preregistered criteria, the hypothesis will be rejected and the project will end with publication of the null result.
