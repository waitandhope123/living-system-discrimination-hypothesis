# Acknowledgments

This project benefited from critical review, methodological challenge, and
epistemic pressure from multiple sources.

The following contributions are acknowledged with gratitude.

---

## Methodological Review and Critique

- **Claude (Anthropic)**  
  For sustained, rigorous critique that prompted the abandonment of premature
  theorizing, enforced falsifiability, and shaped the experimental design into a
  binary empirical gate with no escape hatches.

Claude’s role was adversarial in the best sense: identifying weak links,
challenging assumptions, and insisting on stopping rules and preregistration.

## Conceptual and Structural Assistance

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**  
  For assisting with:
  - refactoring speculative ideas into testable hypotheses,
  - formalizing scope, non-claims, and stopping rules,
  - drafting documentation under explicit human direction,
  - and maintaining internal consistency across repository artifacts.

All final decisions, interpretations, and commitments remain the responsibility
of the human project owner.

## General Thanks

Thanks to:
- reviewers who argued for restraint rather than expansion,
- critics who prioritized falsifiability over narrative,
- and the broader scientific norms that reward being wrong cleanly.

## Responsibility Statement

Acknowledgment does not imply endorsement.

Responsibility for:
- experimental design,
- interpretation,
- ethical considerations,
- and public communication

rests solely with the human project owner.

## Status

Locked.

This acknowledgment applies to Phase 1 of the Living-System Discrimination
Hypothesis project.
