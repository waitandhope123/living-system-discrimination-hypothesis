# Experimental Implications (Conditional)

## Purpose

This document outlines the **only admissible experimental implications**
of Phase 1 of the Living-System Discrimination Hypothesis.

It does **not** assert explanations, mechanisms, or ontology.
It defines what *follows experimentally* from each possible outcome.

---

## If Phase 1 Fails

If Phase 1 fails (primary endpoint confidence interval includes 0.50):

- The hypothesis is rejected.
- No discriminative signal is supported.
- No further experimentation is justified under this project.
- The repository is marked as concluded.
- The null result is published.

No follow-up phases, refinements, or reinterpretations are permitted.

---

## If Phase 1 Succeeds

If Phase 1 succeeds under preregistered criteria:

- The result indicates that a discriminative signal *may* exist.
- The result **does not** establish:
  - a mechanism,
  - a cause,
  - a boundary,
  - a field,
  - or any ontological claim.

The only justified next steps are empirical.

---

## Required Next Steps After Success

All of the following are mandatory before any expansion of scope:

1. **Independent Replication**
   - Conducted by at least one independent group
   - Using the same preregistered protocol
   - With naive experimenters and participants

2. **Robustness Testing**
   - Systematically vary or remove individual controls
   - Identify which controls are load-bearing
   - Confirm the effect does not depend on a single procedural feature

3. **Localization vs Detection Analysis**
   - Use both-live and sham trial performance
   - Determine whether any signal is spatially localizable or diffuse
   - Avoid interpretation beyond what task performance supports

---

## Prohibited Inferences

Even after a successful Phase 1 result, the following inferences remain prohibited:

- Claims about consciousness or awareness
- Claims about non-physical mechanisms
- Claims about fields, forces, or substrates
- Claims about metaphysical or philosophical implications
- Claims about relevance to near-death experiences or psychic phenomena

Such interpretations require independent evidence beyond this project.

---

## Scope Lock

This document applies only to experimental consequences.

Any theoretical, philosophical, or explanatory expansion requires:
- successful independent replication,
- a new manifest,
- and a new preregistration.

---

## Status

Conditional.

This document has no effect unless Phase 1 succeeds.
