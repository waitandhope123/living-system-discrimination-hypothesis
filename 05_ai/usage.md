# AI Usage Disclosure

## Purpose

This document transparently documents the role of artificial intelligence
tools in the development of this repository.

Its purpose is to:
- clarify authorship and responsibility,
- prevent misattribution,
- and ensure accountability for all decisions.

---

## AI Involvement Summary

AI tools were used in a **supportive and advisory capacity** during the
development of this project.

AI systems contributed to:
- clarifying language and structure,
- stress-testing logic and experimental design,
- identifying ambiguity and scope creep,
- drafting documentation under human direction.

AI systems did **not**:
- originate the hypothesis,
- decide experimental outcomes,
- make scientific judgments,
- or assume responsibility for conclusions.

---

## Decision Authority

All substantive decisions regarding:
- scope,
- hypothesis framing,
- experimental design,
- stopping rules,
- interpretation constraints,
- and publication commitments

were made by the human project owner.

AI-generated text was reviewed, edited, and accepted or rejected by the human author.

---

## Accountability

Responsibility for:
- the scientific validity of the protocol,
- ethical considerations,
- interpretation of results,
- and public communication

rests solely with the human project owner.

AI systems bear no responsibility for outcomes or interpretations.

---

## Limitations

AI assistance reflects:
- training data biases,
- probabilistic language generation,
- and lack of independent epistemic agency.

AI outputs were treated as suggestions, not authorities.

---

## Transparency Commitment

This disclosure is provided to:
- allow readers to assess the role of AI,
- maintain trust,
- and model responsible AI-assisted research practices.

---

## Status

Locked.

This disclosure applies to all current and future phases of this repository
unless explicitly superseded.
