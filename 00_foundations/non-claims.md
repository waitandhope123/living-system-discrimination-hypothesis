# Explicit Non-Claims

## Purpose

This document enumerates claims that this project **explicitly does not make**.

Its purpose is to prevent misinterpretation, overextension, and post hoc narrative construction.

No result—positive or negative—may be used to justify any claim listed below.

## Ontological Non-Claims

This project does **not** claim the existence of:
- non-physical substances
- fields, forces, or energies beyond known physics
- substrates underlying spacetime
- consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe
- survival of agency or identity beyond biological systems

---

## Mechanistic Non-Claims

This project does **not** propose or endorse:
- any detection mechanism
- electromagnetic, quantum, or informational channels
- biological sensing beyond known physiology
- explanations involving awareness, intention, or cognition
- interpretations involving boundaries, membranes, or interfaces

No mechanism is assumed or inferred.

## Phenomenological Non-Claims

This project does **not** validate:
- subjective sensations reported outside the protocol
- personal experiences of “fields” or presences
- anecdotal or introspective reports
- altered states of consciousness

- psychic abilities
- extrasensory perception
- mediumship
- telepathy
- clairvoyance
- biofields or auras

No association with parapsychology is asserted.

## Cosmological and Physical Non-Claims

This project does **not** address:
- cosmology
- astrophysics
- fundamental physics
- anomalies in physical law
- the cosmic microwave background
- time, causality, or spacetime structure

All such domains are out of scope.

---

## Interpretive Limits

A successful Phase 1 result indicates only that:
- performance exceeded chance under preregistered conditions.

A failed Phase 1 result indicates that:
- no discriminative signal was detected.

No broader inference is permitted.

---

## Enforcement

Any contribution or interpretation that violates these non-claims:
- will not be merged,
- will be documented as out of scope,
- and may be removed to preserve project integrity.

## Status

Locked.

This document is binding across all phases of this repository.
