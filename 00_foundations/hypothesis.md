# Phase 1 Hypothesis

## Name
Living-System Discrimination Hypothesis (Phase 1)

---

## Formal Hypothesis

**H₁ (Research Hypothesis):**  
Under strict blinding and elimination of known sensory cues, some humans can discriminate the presence or spatial location of living systems at above-chance levels in a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task.

**H₀ (Null Hypothesis):**  
Under strict blinding and elimination of known sensory cues, human performance in a 2AFC task does not differ from chance (50%) when discriminating the presence or spatial location of living systems.

## Operationalization

- **Task:** Two-alternative forced-choice (Left vs Right)
- **Targets:** Living system vs control, with additional sham (control vs control) and both-live (live vs live) trials
- **Response:** Mandatory Left/Right choice followed by confidence rating
- **Primary Endpoint:** Pooled 2AFC accuracy on preregistered primary trials
- **Chance Level:** 0.50

---

## Decision Rule (Binary Gate)

- **Success:**  
  The preregistered 95% confidence interval (Wilson interval on pooled trials) has a lower bound > 0.50 **and** meets the preregistered minimum effect size.

- **Failure:**  
  The confidence interval includes 0.50.

A failure result rejects H₁ and terminates the project.

---

## Interpretation Constraints

- A successful Phase 1 result indicates only that a discriminative signal may exist and warrants independent replication.
- A successful result does **not** imply:
  - a mechanism,
  - localization beyond what is empirically demonstrated,
  - ontological or metaphysical conclusions.

Secondary analyses (confidence calibration, sham trials, both-live trials) may inform interpretation but **cannot override** the primary endpoint.

---

## Scope Lock

This hypothesis applies **only** to Phase 1 as defined in the preregistered protocol.

Any expansion of scope requires:
- independent replication,
- a new manifest,
- and a new preregistration.

---

## Status

Locked.  
No further modification permitted once preregistration is submitted.
