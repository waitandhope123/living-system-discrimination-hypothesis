# Project Roadmap

## Purpose

This roadmap defines the **only permissible future states** of the
Living-System Discrimination Hypothesis project.

It exists to prevent scope creep, indefinite continuation, or narrative
reinterpretation of results.

---

## Current State

**Phase 1: Existence Test**

- Hypothesis is preregistered
- Protocol and stopping rules are locked
- No data collection has yet begun

No other phases are active.

---

## Allowed Transitions

There are only two allowed transitions from Phase 1.

---

## Transition A: Phase 1 Fails

### Condition
- Primary endpoint confidence interval includes 0.50

### Actions
- Hypothesis is rejected
- Data collection stops immediately
- Null result is documented and published
- Repository is marked as concluded
- No further phases are initiated

### Outcome
**Project termination**

This is a valid and complete scientific outcome.

---

## Transition B: Phase 1 Succeeds

### Condition
- Lower bound of preregistered confidence interval > 0.50
- Minimum preregistered effect size met
- Direction consistent across experimenters

### Actions (Mandatory)
1. Independent replication by at least one external group
2. Use of the same preregistered protocol
3. No interpretive expansion or mechanistic claims

### Restrictions
- No transition to explanatory or theoretical phases
- No expansion of scope without replication
- No public framing beyond “signal may exist”

### Outcome
**Replication required before any further consideration**

---

## Prohibited Transitions

The following transitions are explicitly prohibited:

- Phase 1 → Theory development
- Phase 1 → Mechanism speculation
- Phase 1 → Ontological claims
- Phase 1 → Philosophical interpretation
- Phase 1 → Continued data collection after failure
- Phase 1 → Redefinition of success

---

## Phase Advancement Rules

Any advancement beyond Phase 1 requires:
- Successful independent replication
- A new manifest
- A new preregistration
- Explicit justification for expanded scope

Absent these conditions, the project does not advance.

---

## Status

Locked.

This roadmap applies until Phase 1 concludes.
