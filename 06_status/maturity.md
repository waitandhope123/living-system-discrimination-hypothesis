# Project Maturity

## Current Stage

This project is at **Phase 1: Existence Testing**.

At this stage:
- No mechanism is proposed.
- No explanatory framework is advanced.
- No theoretical claims are defended.
- No ontological conclusions are permitted.

The sole objective is to determine whether a discriminative signal exists at all under strict blinding.

## What “Phase 1” Means

Phase 1 is a **gate**, not a progression.

Its purpose is to answer one question:

> Does performance exceed chance under preregistered conditions?

Phase 1 does not ask:
- why a result occurs,
- how it occurs,
- or what it “means” beyond task performance.

---

## Consequences of Outcomes

### If Phase 1 Fails
- The hypothesis is rejected.
- The project terminates.
- The repository is marked as concluded.
- Results are published as a null.

This is considered a successful outcome in terms of scientific integrity.

---

### If Phase 1 Succeeds
- The result is treated as provisional.
- Independent replication becomes mandatory.
- Project maturity remains **pre-theoretical**.
- No explanatory expansion is allowed.

Advancement beyond Phase 1 requires a new manifest and independent justification.

## Public Representation

This repository must not be described as:
- a theory of life or consciousness,
- evidence of non-physical phenomena,
- validation of subjective experience,
- or support for metaphysical claims.

Any such representation is inaccurate.
