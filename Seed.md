Context Seed — Living-System Discrimination Hypothesis (Phase 1)

This repository contains Phase 1 of the Living-System Discrimination Hypothesis.

Current scope:
- The project tests a single empirical claim:
  Whether humans can discriminate the presence or spatial location of living systems above chance under strict blinding.
- The experiment uses a preregistered two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) design with a binary stopping rule.
- Phase 1 is an existence test only. No mechanisms, explanations, or ontological claims are proposed or assumed.

Status:
- Phase 1 protocol, analysis plan, and stopping rules are locked.
- Success requires the preregistered confidence interval lower bound to exceed chance and a minimum effect size to be met.
- Failure (CI includes chance) terminates the project and results in publication of a null outcome.
- No theory rescue, reinterpretation, or scope expansion is permitted.

Interpretation constraints:
- A positive Phase 1 result indicates only that a discriminative signal may exist and warrants independent replication.
- A negative result conclusively rejects the hypothesis.
- No claims about consciousness, fields, mechanisms, metaphysics, or physics are justified by Phase 1 outcomes.

Structure note:
- This repository follows a standardized directory layout used across related projects for consistency.
- The presence of directories does not imply active use or scope inclusion.
- Only Phase 1 documents explicitly populated and referenced by the manifest define the active scope; other sections are placeholders unless stated otherwise.

Phase boundary:
- Advancement beyond Phase 1 requires successful independent replication, a new manifest, and a new preregistration.
- Until then, the project remains pre-theoretical and empirically constrained.

This context seed defines the authoritative interpretive frame for the repository.
