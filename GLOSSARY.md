# Glossary

This glossary defines terms as they are used **specifically within this repository**.
Definitions here override colloquial, philosophical, or speculative meanings.

---

## Living System
A biological organism that meets standard criteria for life (e.g., metabolism, homeostasis).
In Phase 1, this refers only to the experimental targets defined in the preregistered protocol.
No claims about consciousness or awareness are implied.

---

## Control
A non-living condition matched as closely as possible to the living system on all known sensory dimensions (e.g., temperature, mass, enclosure), as defined in the preregistered protocol.

---

## Discrimination
The ability to distinguish between two alternatives at rates exceeding chance in a forced-choice task.
Discrimination implies no mechanism, explanation, or subjective experience.

---

## 2AFC (Two-Alternative Forced Choice)
An experimental paradigm in which participants must choose between exactly two options on each trial.
Chance performance is defined as 50%.

---

## Chance
The expected accuracy (0.50) in a 2AFC task if no discriminative signal exists.

---

## Primary Endpoint
The preregistered main outcome measure used to determine success or failure.
In this project, pooled 2AFC accuracy evaluated against a preregistered confidence interval.

---

## Confidence Interval (CI)
A statistical interval estimating uncertainty around the primary endpoint.
Unless otherwise stated, this refers to the preregistered 95% Wilson interval.

---

## Minimum Effect Size
The smallest preregistered deviation from chance considered meaningful for Phase 1.
This threshold is numeric and fixed prior to data collection.

---

## Blinding
Procedural controls ensuring that participants, experimenters, and analysts do not have access to information that could bias outcomes.

---

## Sham Trial
A trial in which both alternatives are controls.
Used to detect expectancy effects, guessing biases, or procedural leakage.

---

## Both-Live Trial
A trial in which both alternatives contain living systems.
Used to test whether any detected signal is spatially localizable versus diffuse.

---

## Phase 1
The initial existence test for the Living-System Discrimination Hypothesis.
Phase 1 is a binary gate and does not advance explanatory claims.

---

## Success (Phase 1)
A preregistered outcome in which the lower bound of the confidence interval exceeds chance and the minimum effect size is met.

---

## Failure (Phase 1)
A preregistered outcome in which the confidence interval includes chance.
Failure terminates the project.

---

## Preregistration
Public documentation of hypotheses, methods, analysis plans, and stopping rules prior to data collection.

---

## Null Result
An outcome consistent with chance performance.
In this project, a null result is considered a valid and complete scientific conclusion.

---

## Scope Creep
The introduction of claims, interpretations, or objectives beyond those preregistered.
Explicitly prohibited in this repository.

---

## Ontological Claim
A claim about the fundamental nature of reality.
All ontological claims are out of scope for this project.

---

## Status

Locked.
