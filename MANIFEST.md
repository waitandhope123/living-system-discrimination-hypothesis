# MANIFEST

## Project Name
Living-System Discrimination Hypothesis (Phase 1)

## Purpose

This repository exists to conduct a single, preregistered empirical test:

> Whether humans can discriminate the presence or spatial location of living systems above chance under strict blinding.

This is an existence test only. It is designed to fail decisively if no real signal exists.

---

Repository Structure Note
This repository follows a standardized directory layout used across related projects for consistency.
The presence of directories does not imply active use or scope inclusion.
Only the Phase 1 documents explicitly populated and referenced by this manifest define the active scope; other sections are placeholders unless stated otherwise.

---

## Epistemic Status

This project is **empirical and falsification-driven**.

- No claim in this repository is treated as true by default.
- The central hypothesis is expected to fail unless evidence demonstrates otherwise.
- A null result is considered a valid and complete outcome.

This repository does not advance, defend, or promote any ontological, metaphysical, or explanatory framework.

---

## Scope (Hard Limits)

### In Scope
- A two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) discrimination task
- Strict blinding and preregistration
- A binary success/failure decision rule
- Publication of null results
- Replication as a prerequisite for further work

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Mechanistic explanations
- Fields, forces, or substrates
- Consciousness theories
- Psychic or paranormal claims
- Near-death experiences
- Cosmology or physics beyond known models
- Philosophical or metaphysical interpretation

No material outside the defined scope may be introduced to reinterpret results.

---

## Success and Failure Conditions

### Success
- The preregistered primary endpoint exceeds chance:
  - Lower bound of the preregistered confidence interval > 0.50
  - Minimum preregistered effect size met
- Result direction is consistent across experimenters

A successful Phase 1 result indicates only that a signal may exist and warrants independent replication.

### Failure
- The confidence interval includes 0.50

Failure terminates the project.  
No theory rescue, reinterpretation, or parameter adjustment is permitted.

---

## Commitments

The project commits to:
- Public preregistration of protocol, analysis plan, and stopping rules
- No mid-experiment procedural changes
- Publication of null results
- Immediate independent replication before any expansion of scope

---

## Governance

- This repository does not operate by consensus.
- Design decisions are frozen once preregistered.
- Contributions that attempt to expand scope or reintroduce excluded claims will not be merged.

---

## Rationale

Many speculative ideas persist because they are never placed behind a test that can decisively reject them.

This repository exists to demonstrate the opposite approach:
reduce a subjective intuition to a narrow empirical claim, design a test capable of killing it, and accept the outcome.

---

## Version

This manifest applies to Phase 1 only.
Any subsequent phase requires a new manifest and independent justification.
